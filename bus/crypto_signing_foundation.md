# Request to: claude_code

## Task
Implement the **foundation for cryptographic signatures** in ZeroTrustBus:
- Add interface + stub module `crypto/signing.py` with `sign_message(payload) -> Signature` and `verify_signature(payload, signature) -> bool`.
- Use a feature flag `FEATURE_CRYPTO_SIGNING` defaulting to off.
- Wire a minimal call site in `zero_trust_research/zero_trust_architecture.py` behind the flag (no production enforcement yet).
- Provide 1–2 unit tests with deterministic inputs (golden vectors mocked).

## Constraints
- Incremental, testable, defensive; **no real keys checked in**.
- Keep private inputs private; only public response & diff via `bus/responses/`. 
- Follow the **Claude Code Response Template** in your reply. 
- Commit artifacts to a new branch `feat/crypto-signing-foundation`.

## Success Criteria
- Tests green locally; CI script placeholder OK.
- Bus can toggle the flag to exercise stubbed path without breaking existing flows.
- Clear TODOs for next step: key management & real signature scheme.

## Notes (context)
- This item is in “needs foundation”. Minimal, reversible change preferred. 


then [[openai]] said the following me as a bus, as bus implementor we want to share that too:

Implementation Status
- Task: Cryptographic signature foundation with feature flag and tests
- Status: completed
- Files Modified: 
  - zero_trust_research/zero_trust_architecture.py
  - zero_trust_research/crypto/signing.py
  - zero_trust_research/tests/test_signing.py
- Tests Status: passed

Results
- What was implemented: Introduced signing interface + verify stub; gated integration via FEATURE_CRYPTO_SIGNING.
- Code changes: Added module with placeholder algorithms; injected call site behind env flag; wrote deterministic unit tests with mocks.
- New functionality: Bus can enable flag to route messages through signing stub without enforcing real cryptography.

Concerns & Blockers
- Security concerns: No real crypto yet; stubs MUST NOT be used in production.
- Technical blockers: Key management design + algorithm choice pending (Ed25519 vs ECDSA); secret storage requirements.
- Clarification needed: Confirm preferred signature scheme and KMS approach.

GitHub Artifacts
- Commit hash: [hash]
- Branch: feat/crypto-signing-foundation
- Files to review: paths above

Next Actions Required
- From bus: Provide decision on signature scheme + KMS, and whether to enforce verify() when flag is on.
- From other components: Architecture sign-off; threat model inputs.
- Priority level: normal

Critical Reasoning Applied
- Safety validation: No secrets committed; strictly stubbed; feature-flagged to prevent unintended activation.
- Incremental approach: Isolated module + tests; minimal touch to existing flow.
- Context preservation: Public response only; sensitive design details kept in private channel as per comms asymmetry policy.
