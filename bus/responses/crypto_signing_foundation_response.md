## Implementation Status
- Task: Cryptographic signature foundation with feature flag and tests
- Status: completed
- Files Modified: 
  - zero_trust_research/zero_trust_architecture.py
  - zero_trust_research/crypto/signing.py (new)
  - zero_trust_research/crypto/__init__.py (new)
  - zero_trust_research/tests/test_signing.py (new)
  - zero_trust_research/tests/__init__.py (new)
  - zero_trust_research/test_crypto_integration.py (new)
- Tests Status: passed (9 unit tests + integration tests)

## Results
- What was implemented: Introduced signing interface with sign_message() and verify_signature() functions; gated integration via FEATURE_CRYPTO_SIGNING environment variable.
- Code changes: Added crypto.signing module with STUB_SHA256 placeholder algorithm; injected cryptographic validation into ZeroTrustBus.validate_message() behind feature flag; wrote deterministic unit tests with golden vectors.
- New functionality: Bus can enable FEATURE_CRYPTO_SIGNING=true to route messages through cryptographic signature validation without enforcing real cryptography.

## Concerns & Blockers
- Security concerns: STUB implementation MUST NOT be used in production - clearly marked throughout codebase with warnings.
- Technical blockers: Key management design + algorithm choice pending (Ed25519 vs ECDSA); secure key storage requirements undefined.
- Clarification needed: Confirm preferred signature scheme (Ed25519/ECDSA) and KMS approach for production implementation.

## GitHub Artifacts
- Commit hash: f29d6d0
- Branch: feat/crypto-signing-foundation
- Files to review: 
  - zero_trust_research/crypto/signing.py:1-134 (core interface)
  - zero_trust_research/zero_trust_architecture.py:18-25,47,197-211 (integration points)
  - zero_trust_research/tests/test_signing.py:1-167 (test suite)

## Next Actions Required
- From bus: Provide decision on signature scheme (Ed25519/ECDSA) + KMS approach, and whether to enforce verify() when flag is enabled.
- From other components: Architecture sign-off for key management design; threat model inputs for production crypto requirements.  
- Priority level: normal

## Critical Reasoning Applied
- Safety validation: No secrets committed; strictly stubbed with deterministic test vectors; feature-flagged to prevent unintended activation.
- Incremental approach: Isolated crypto module + comprehensive tests; minimal touch to existing message flow (backward compatible).
- Context preservation: Public response only via bus/responses/; sensitive implementation details available through GitHub artifacts as per comms asymmetry policy.
