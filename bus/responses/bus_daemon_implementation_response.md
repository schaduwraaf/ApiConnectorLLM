## Implementation Status
- Task: BusDaemon prototype for automated bus coordination
- Status: completed
- Files Modified:
  - bus/bus_daemon.py (new - main daemon process)
  - bus/tests/test_bus_daemon.py (new - comprehensive test suite)
  - bus/README.md (new - usage documentation)
  - zero_trust_research/CRYPTO_DOCUMENTATION.md (updated - bus integration)
  - bus/examples/ (new - example messages and documentation)
- Tests Status: passed (10 comprehensive unit/integration tests)

## Results
- What was implemented: Complete BusDaemon automation replacing manual message coordination; file-based inbox/outbox processing; Ed25519 signature validation; zero-trust routing with constitutional protection.
- Code changes: Created ComponentMessage/WellbeingStatus classes; integrated existing Ed25519 crypto system; implemented comprehensive error handling; added detailed logging and audit trail.
- New functionality: Automated message processing from inbox/ to outbox/; cryptographic signature validation; zero-trust bus routing; signed response generation; comprehensive error reporting.

## Concerns & Blockers
- Security concerns: Current implementation uses file-based polling - suitable for prototype but may need message queue for high-throughput production deployment.
- Technical blockers: None - all core functionality implemented and tested. Public key discovery uses simple file patterns pending full PKI integration.
- Clarification needed: Deployment model for multi-daemon scenarios and integration with external message brokers.

## GitHub Artifacts
- Commit hash: e0ad9f2
- Branch: feat/crypto-signing-foundation
- Files to review:
  - bus/bus_daemon.py:1-600 (main daemon implementation)
  - bus/tests/test_bus_daemon.py:1-400 (comprehensive test suite)
  - bus/README.md (complete usage guide)
  - bus/examples/ (working message examples)

## Next Actions Required
- From bus: Decision on production deployment model and message queue integration timeline.
- From other components: Testing with real component messages and validation of bus automation effectiveness.
- Priority level: normal (prototype complete and functional)

## Critical Reasoning Applied
- Security validation: All Ed25519 signature verification maintained; constitutional autistic verifier protections enforced; comprehensive audit logging implemented.
- Incremental approach: Built on existing Ed25519 and zero-trust architecture; maintains backward compatibility; provides clear upgrade path.
- Context preservation: Complete documentation provided; all examples working; clear security model documented for future enhancements.

## Success Criteria Verification
✅ `python bus_daemon.py` starts automated message processing daemon  
✅ Messages in `inbox/` automatically processed, validated, and routed  
✅ Invalid signatures/messages rejected with detailed error reports in `outbox/`  
✅ Guardian→autistic verifier message flow demonstrated end-to-end  
✅ All constitutional protections maintained and enhanced with automation  
✅ Comprehensive logging provides complete audit trail  
✅ 10 unit/integration tests verify all functionality  

## Demo Verification
Successfully demonstrated:
- Message structure validation (rejects missing fields)
- Timestamp validation (rejects stale messages per autistic verifier)  
- Signature validation (integrates with Ed25519 system)
- Error reporting (detailed failure analysis in outbox)
- Constitutional protection (autistic verifier flags preserved)

The human bus coordinator role is now successfully automated while maintaining all security guarantees.
