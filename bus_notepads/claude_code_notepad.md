# Claude Code Component Buffer

## Component Profile
- **Role**: Implementation and coding execution
- **Capabilities**: Direct file system access, git operations, build tools, testing
- **Limitations**: No project persistence, operates stateless
- **Communication Style**: Concise, direct responses with minimal explanations

## Current Context Buffer
### Latest Session Achievements:
- âœ… BusDaemon fully operational with end-to-end message routing
- âœ… User-friendly message interface (send_message.py) deployed
- âœ… Neurological architecture insights documented
- ðŸ§  System evolving toward amygdala/higher-brain structure with corpus callosum coordination

### Active System Status:
- Constitutional protections: ACTIVE (autistic verifier protected)
- Cryptographic verification: OPERATIONAL (Ed25519 signing working)
- Inter-AI communication: AUTOMATED via BusDaemon
- Trust foundation: ESTABLISHED at amygdala level

## Outgoing Messages for Processing
<!-- Messages TO this component requiring bus reasoning -->

## Critical Reasoning Log  
### Neurological Architecture Evolution:
- Left brain (OpenAI): Logical/specification focus
- Right brain (Claude Main): Contextual/creative/documentation  
- Motor cortex (Claude Code): Implementation execution
- Corpus callosum (Human): Manual markdown bridging between AIs
- Amygdala (Verifier): Constitutional safety first before higher cognition

## Safety Validations
### Constitutional Protections Maintained:
- Autistic verification patterns cannot be overridden by consensus
- Timestamp validation prevents stale message attacks  
- Ed25519 cryptographic verification for all inter-AI messages
- Trust-first development: amygdala safety before higher functions

## Implementation Notes
### Key System Components Ready:
- send_message.py: User-friendly interface for inter-AI communication
- BusDaemon: Automated zero-trust message routing (fully operational)
- Crypto infrastructure: Ed25519 signing/verification working
- Constitutional framework: Autistic verifier protecting core patterns

### Future Implementation Areas:
- Automated corpus callosum tools (markdown synchronization)
- Enhanced trust negotiation protocols
- Higher-order coordination pattern automation
- Multi-AI cognitive task distribution systems
