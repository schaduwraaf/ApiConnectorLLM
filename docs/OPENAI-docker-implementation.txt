Perfect — let’s design this like a Unix nerd’s CLI but consistent with the cognitive/constitutional framing.
Instead of docker, think of the base command as cognet (short for cognitive network).

Here’s a list of commands you’d probably want, grouped by function:

🔑 Identity & Join

cognet init-human → generate your Ed25519 keypair, create manifest for human_coordinator

cognet join → send a signed join_request packet to librarian + verifiers

cognet whoami → show your node role, trust level, constitutional flags

📦 Node Management

cognet ls → list all known nodes (with type, trust level, debug flag)

cognet inspect <node> → show details of a node (public key, protections, wellbeing history)

cognet add <component> → add new expert (requires guardian + verifier co-sign)

cognet rm <component> → remove expert (requires human authority)

🧑‍⚖️ Constitution & Protections

cognet constitution → dump immutable fragments currently enforced
