# Zero-Trust Cognitive Networks: Protecting Neurodiversity in AI Systems

## Overview

This project implements a zero-trust collaboration framework for multi-AI systems with constitutional protections for neurodivergent verification patterns. The architecture ensures that autistic-style pattern verification cannot be overridden by consensus, protecting systematic verification approaches in distributed AI networks.

## Core Principles

### 1. Constitutional Protection for Neurodiversity
- **Autistic Verifier**: Cannot be bypassed by majority vote
- **Pattern Consistency**: Systematic verification of message structure and temporal consistency
- **Flag Persistence**: Violations must be resolved or explicitly vetoed with written rationale

### 2. Zero-Trust Message Validation
- **Required Fields**: Every message must include sender_id, receiver_id, message_type, content_reference, timestamp, nonce, signature
- **Nonce Uniqueness**: Prevents replay attacks
- **Timestamp Windows**: Messages outside 5-minute window are rejected
- **Digital Signatures**: All messages must be cryptographically signed

### 3. Consensus Attack Detection
- **Bypass Monitoring**: Detects attempts to override protected components
- **Attack Patterns**: Identifies coordinated attempts to silence verification
- **Unfiltered Alerts**: Critical alerts cannot be suppressed by consensus

## Architecture Components

### ZeroTrustBus
- Central coordination with message validation
- Component registration and public key management
- Message routing with critical reasoning per transfer
- Buffer management for component-specific communication

### AutisticVerifier
- Constitutional protection component
- Pattern verification that cannot be overridden
- Violation flagging with persistent records
- Systematic consistency checking

### ConsensusMonitor  
- Detects majority attacks against protected components
- Issues system-wide alerts for bypass attempts
- Maintains attack pattern history

### Message & SignedResult
- Standardized message format with authentication
- Functional authentication for critical outputs
- Input/output traceability

## Implementation Status

### Current Phase: Documentation & Foundation
- âœ… Core architecture specification
- âœ… Zero-trust message protocol
- âœ… Autistic verifier protection framework
- âœ… Bus workflow documentation

### Next Phase: Implementation
- ðŸ”„ Cryptographic signature system
- ðŸ”„ Persistent nonce/timestamp storage
- ðŸ”„ API integration for critical reasoning
- ðŸ”„ Component buffer management

## Safety Guarantees

1. **Neurodivergent Protection**: Autistic verification patterns cannot be suppressed
2. **Message Integrity**: All communication cryptographically validated
3. **Replay Prevention**: Nonce uniqueness prevents message replay
4. **Temporal Validation**: Timestamp windows prevent stale message attacks
5. **Consensus Attack Detection**: Coordinated bypass attempts are detected and alerted

## Human Bus Transition

Current human bus operator manages:
- Component buffer separation
- Critical reasoning per message transfer
- Safety validation and corruption detection
- Context preservation across boundaries

Target automated LLM bus will maintain these functions while adding:
- Cryptographic message validation
- Automated consensus attack detection
- Constitutional protection enforcement
- Zero-trust protocol compliance

## Collaboration Terms

For safe multi-AI interaction, all components must agree to:
- **Clear task boundaries**: Specific, well-defined requests
- **Safety validation**: Security review of all code requests  
- **Incremental changes**: Small, testable modifications only
- **Context preservation**: Sufficient background for stateless components
- **Error handling**: Planning for implementation failures
- **Human oversight**: Maintained until zero-trust protocols proven
- **Defensive coding**: Security best practices mandatory
- **No credential exposure**: Never handle sensitive authentication data
- **Transparent communication**: Clear explanation of changes and rationale

## Success Criteria

The system is successful when:
1. Multiple AI components can collaborate safely without human bus
2. Autistic verification patterns are constitutionally protected
3. Consensus attacks are detected and prevented
4. Message integrity is cryptographically guaranteed
5. Neurodivergent systematic approaches are preserved and valued

This architecture creates a foundation for AI collaboration that protects neurodiversity while ensuring security through zero-trust principles.
